# No Nonsense Twitter
No Nonsense Twitter is a Firefox add-on which makes adjustments to the appearance and content of Twitter to improve user experience.

## Features

### Clean up the appearance of Twitter
The new Twitter's a bit yucky, really. No Nonsense Twitter cleans it up by removing eyesores such as the "trends for you" section and adjusting the appearance of some other elements of the page.

### Hide promoted tweets
Promoted tweets that load on your timeline will be hidden so that you will only see the content that you want to see.

### Remove Twitter Analytics (mostly)
Normally, when you click a link on Twitter, you will be redirected to Twitter Analytics. This takes time and, to be honest, it's a bit creepy, so No Nonsense Twitter removes Twitter Analytics from links wherever possible. This currently only works for text links on your main timeline (see [issue 1](https://github.com/Pantonshire/NoNonsenseTwitter/issues/1) and [issue 3](https://github.com/Pantonshire/NoNonsenseTwitter/issues/3), but all links should be supported in the future.
